  - ai-scribe-ws-connections-prod
- **Services**: Lambda functions, Cognito User Pool, DynamoDB tables all operational

#### Frontend UI (Newly Created)
- **Deployed URL**: https://frontend-mqhmlxltf-transcendentals-projects.vercel.app
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js 15.4.6, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v3, React Query
- **Components Created**:
  1. **Dashboard Page** (`/app/page.tsx`)
     - Daily encounter list view
     - Status summary cards (Total, Checked In, In Progress, Completed)
     - Real-time data fetching with React Query
  
  2. **Encounter Card Component** (`/components/encounter-card.tsx`)
     - Visual status indicators with color coding
     - Patient information display
     - Recording consent status icons
     - Action buttons based on encounter status
  
  3. **Patient Search Component** (`/components/patient-search.tsx`)
     - Auto-complete search functionality
     - Search by patient name or MRN
     - Debounced search for performance
     - Dropdown with patient details
  
  4. **Consent Capture Dialog** (`/components/consent-dialog.tsx`)
     - Interactive consent selection
     - Three consent types: Recording, Data Sharing, Treatment
     - Required consent validation
     - Optional notes field
  
  5. **Encounter Detail Page** (`/app/encounters/[id]/page.tsx`)
     - Complete encounter workflow management
     - Visual status timeline
     - Patient and location information
     - Consent management interface
  
  6. **Recording Interface** (`/components/recording-interface.tsx`)
     - Real-time audio level visualization
     - Recording duration timer
     - Play/Pause/Stop controls
     - Recording tips and status indicators

## Known Issues

1. **CORS Configuration**: 
   - The production API is not returning proper CORS headers
   - Temporary workaround: Created API proxy route at `/api/proxy/[...path]`
   - Permanent fix needed: Redeploy Lambda functions with updated response headers

2. **Authentication**:
   - No login page implemented yet
   - Frontend expects JWT tokens from Cognito but no auth flow exists
   - Users cannot currently authenticate to test the application

3. **CSS Styling**:
   - Initially had issues with Tailwind CSS v4
   - Resolved by downgrading to v3
   - All styling now working correctly

## What's Left to Complete

### High Priority
1. **Authentication Module UI**
   - Login page
   - Registration page
   - Password reset flow
   - Session management

2. **Fix CORS on Backend**
   - Redeploy Lambda functions with proper CORS headers
   - Remove temporary proxy workaround

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add proper error boundaries
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests
   - User-friendly error messages

### Medium Priority
1. **Additional Features**
   - Encounter scheduling
   - Provider profile management
   - Export functionality for encounters
   - Print-friendly views

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for API calls
   - E2E tests for critical workflows

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Add loading skeletons
   - Optimize bundle size

### Low Priority
1. **UI Enhancements**
   - Dark mode support
   - Mobile-responsive improvements
   - Accessibility audit and fixes
   - Animation refinements

## Technical Debt
1. Remove API proxy once CORS is fixed
2. Add proper TypeScript types for all API responses
3. Implement proper error logging and monitoring
4. Add environment-specific configurations

## Deployment Information
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments
- **Backend**: Deployed on AWS using CDK (production stack)
- **Database**: DynamoDB with single-table design
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito (configured but no UI)

## Next Steps
1. Implement authentication UI to allow users to log in
2. Fix CORS headers on the backend Lambda functions
3. Add error handling and loading states
4. Conduct user testing once auth is working

## Notes
- The backend infrastructure was pre-existing and fully deployed
- Only the frontend UI was created in this session
- The application is HIPAA-compliant with encryption and audit logging
- All PHI access is logged in the audit table
